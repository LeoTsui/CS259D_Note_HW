### Mixing Algorithm

#### Notation

* $$T$$, $$\#$$ instances
* $$t$$, $$(t=1,...,T)$$, a certain time or trial
* $$n$$, $$\#$$ base IDSs
* $$i$$, $$i \in \{ 1, 2, ..., n \}$$, the index of base IDSs
* $$x_t$$, a vector of $$n$$ IDS's output
    * A-IDS receives $$x_t$$
    * $$x_t = (x_{t,1}, ..., x_{t,n})$$
        * where $$x_{t, i} \in \{0\text{(normal)}, 1\text{(attack)}\}$$
* $$pred(t)$$, the prediction of A-IDS
* $$y_t$$, $$y_t \in \{0, 1\}$$, the true label of the $$t\text{-th}$$ instance at the time $$t$$
* $$L$$, loss function
    * For the trial $$t$$, and the $$i\text{-th}$$ IDS
    * $$L_{t, i} = (y_t - x_{t, i})^2$$
    * Measure the discrepancy between the true label and the predictions of the base IDSs
* $$v_t$$, the weight vector maintained by the A-IDS
    * $$v_t = (v_{t,1}, v_{t,2}, ..., v_{t,n})$$
    * $$v_{t,i} \geq 0$$
    * $$\sum_{i = 1}^n v_{t,i} = 1$$

#### Algorithm

* Parameters
    * $$\eta > 0$$, learning rate
    * $$0 \leq \alpha \leq 1$$
    * $$n$$
* Initialization
    * $$v_1 = v_0^m = (1/n, ...,  1/n, ..., 1/n)$$
* For $$t=1 \to T$$
    * Prediction
        * $$\hat y_t = v_t \cdot x_t$$
        * $$pred(t)$$:
            * $$0$$, $$0 \leq \hat y_t \leq 0.5$$
            * $$1$$, $$\hat y_t \geq 0.5$$
    * *Loss Update*
        * Find the best IDS from a pool of $$n$$ base ones
        * $$L_{t, i} = (y_t - x_{t, i})^2$$
        * $$e^{-\eta L_{t,i}}$$, a factor
        * $$v_{t,i}^m = {v_{t,i} e^{-\eta L_{t,i}}} / {\sum_{j=1}^n v_{t,j} e^{-\eta L_{t,j}}}$$
    * *Mixing Update*
        * $$av_t = \frac{1}{t} \sum_{q=0}^{t-1} v_q^m$$, average weight vector 
        * $$v_{t+1} = \alpha av_t + (1-\alpha)v_t^m$$

## Experimental

* Expert setting (Not Mixing Update)
    * Single intrusion detection cannot detect all types
        * Good performance on special segments
        * Need combination
    * *Loss Update*
        * $$\eta = 0.1$$
    * Not *Mixing Update*
        * $$v_{t_1,i} = v_{t,i}^m$$
        * Combination is not help
        * The performance is almost the same as the best IDS
* Expert Combining (A-IDS)
    * Simulate adversarial environment
        * Random permutation
    * 10-folds cross-validation
    * Mixing Algorithm
        * $$\eta = 0.1$$
        * $$\alpha = 0.001$$
        * Uniform Past update
* Expert Expanding (A-ExIDS)

## Limitation

* Lose Update is double-edge knife
    * The best $$v_{t,i}$$($$L_{t,i} = 0$$) controls $$v_{t,i}^m$$
    * Hard to recover if an IDS temporarily performs poorly and then performs well
    * Consequence
        * Slow adaptation about changes in IDSs' performances
        * Attackers can change attack patterns all the times
