### Time-Based Features

* Insight
    * Malicious domains often increase suddenly and decrease suddenly in the number of requests
* Analyse method
    * Divide period into fixed length intervals
    * Count queries
* Global scope
    * Short life
        * DGA(domain generation algorithm) generate domains
    * Change behavior
* Local scope
    * Main idea
        * Zoom into the life time of a domain
        * Study behavioral characteristics
    * Daily similarity
        * An increase or decrease of request count at same intervals everyday
    * Regularly repeating patterns
        * Instance of change point detection (CPD)
        * $$\#$$ changes
        * $$SD$$ the durations of detected changes
    * Access ratio
        * Idle vs popular

#### Change Point Detection (CPD)

* Operate on time series
* Goal to find points, which data values change abruptly
* Detecting abrupt changes
    * Time series for each domain
        * $$P(t)$$, Request count at hour $$t$$, normalized by max count
        * Iterate time interval $$t = 3600s$$
        * $$P^-(t)$$, Average of past $$8$$ time intervals
        * $$P^+(t)$$, Average of next $$8$$ time intervals
        * $$d(t) = |P^+(t) - P^-(t)|$$
    * Apply Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) algorithm to $$d(t)$$
        * Detect times $$t$$, when $$d(t)$$ is large and is a $$local\_max$$
        * $$CUSUM(t) = Max\{0, CUSUM(t-1) + d(t) - local\_max\}$$
        * Report $$t$$ as change point if: $$CUSUM(t) > cusum\_max$$

#### Detecting Similar Daily Behavior

* Compute distances of all pairs of daily time series
    * Normalized each time series by its $$Avg$$ and $$SD$$
    * Use Euclidian distance
* $$d_{ij}$$, Euclidian distance between $$i^{th}$$ & $$j^{th}$$ days
* $$D$$, $$Avg$$ all $$d_{ij}$$ values

### DNS Answer-Based Features

* Domains map to multiple IPs, and IPs be shared across different domains
* $$\#$$ distinct IP addresses
    * Resolved for a domain during the experiment
* $$\#$$ distinct countries that IP addresses located
* $$\#$$ domains share the IP
    * Can be large for web hosting providers as well
* Reverse DNS query results
    * Reduce false positives by looking for reverse DNS query results on Google top 3 search results

### TTL Value-Based Features

* TTL(Time To Live): Length of time to cache a DNS response
    * Recommended between 1-5 days
* Insight
    * Sophisticated infrastructure of malicious networks cause frequent TTL changes
    * Setting lower TTL values to the less reliable hosts
* $$Avg$$ TTL
    * High availability systems
        * Low TTL values
        * Round Robin DNS
        * Example: CDNs, Fast Flux botnets
* $$SD$$ TTL
    * Compromised home computers (dynamic IP) assigned much shorter TTL than compromised servers (static IP)
* $$\#$$ distinct TTL values
* $$\#$$ TTL change
    * Higher in malicious domains
* Percentage usage of specific TTL ranges
    * Considered ranges: $$[0,1), [1,10), [10,100), [100,300), [300,900), [900, inf)$$
    * Malicious domains peak at $$[0, 100)$$ ranges

### Domain Name-Based Features

* Insight
    * Easy-to-remember names
        * Important for benign services
        * Main purpose of DNS
    * Unimportant for attackers (e.g., DGA-generated)
* Ratio of numerical characters to name length
* Ratio of length of the longest meaningful substring (LMS) to length of domain name
    * Query name on Google & check the number of hits vs a threshold
* Features applied to only second-level domains(SLD)
    * `x.y.server.com` $$\rightarrow$$ `server.com`
* Other possible feature: entropy of the domain name
    * DGA-generated names more random than human-generated

## Training

* Training period
    * Initial period of 7 days (for time-based features)
    * Retraining every day

### The Classifier

* J48 decision tree
    * C4.5
* Feature selection
    * Percentage of miss-classified instances

#### C4.5 decision tree algorithm

* Check for base cases
* For each attribute
    * Compute attribute's normalized information gain
* Split over attribute with highest gain
* Recurse
* Normalized information gain = difference in entropy of class values

## Evaluation

* Evaluation of the Detection Rate
    * 569 domains reported by `malwareurls.com`
        * 219 domains queried in the monitored network
    * 5 had less than 20 queries
        * be filtered
    * 211 detected malicious
    * Detection rate: 98%
* Evaluation of the False Positives
    * Filter out domains with < 20 requests in 2.5 months (300,000 domains remaining)
    * 17,686 detected as malicious (5.9%)
    * Unlabeled domains
        * Hard to verify manually
    * Verification
        * Google searches
        * Well-known spam lists
        * Norton Safe Web
        * McAfee Site Advisor
    * False positive rate: 7.9%

## Limitation (Evasion)

* Attackers have prior information about EXPOSURE
* Assign uniform TTL values across all compromised machines
    * Reduces attacker's infrastructure reliability
* Reduce number of DNS lookups of malicious domain
    * Not trivial to implement
    * Reduces attacker's impact
    * Requires high degree of coordination
