## Background Knowledge and Insight

* Network traffic flow analysis
    * Volume-based analysis
    * Distribution-based analysis
        * More succinct
        * Requires appropriate metrics to encapsulate and capture features
* Measure distribution

## Formulation

### Notation

* $$[n]=\{1,2,3,...,n\}$$, set of all items come over the stream
    * $$n$$ can be various when measuring different features
        * Port
        * Source or destination addresses
* $$m_i$$, the frequency of item $$i \in [n]$$
* $$m$$, the total number of items in the stream
    * $$m = \sum_{i=1}^n m_i$$
* $$a_j \in [n]$$, the $$j\text{th}$$ item obersved in the stream
* $$n_0$$, $$\#$$ different items appeared in the stream
    * Not all $$n$$ items are present
* $$n \gg m$$
* $$H \equiv - \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{m_i}{m} \log \frac{m_i}{m}$$

<p align="center">$$H = \log m - \frac{1}{m} \sum_i m_i \log m_i$$</p>

### Relative Error

* $$S \equiv \sum_i m_i \log m_i$$

<p align="center">$$H = \log m - \frac{S}{m}$$</p>

* $$\vert S - \tilde{S} \vert / S$$
    * $$S$$, true value
    * $$\tilde{S}$$, estimated value
* $$\tilde{H} = \log m - \tilde{S} / m$$, estimated value of $$H$$
* $$S$$ with relative error at most $$\epsilon$$
    * $$(1-\epsilon)S \le \tilde{S} \le (1+\epsilon)S$$

<p align="center">$$\frac{\vert H - \tilde{H} \vert}{H} \le \epsilon \frac{S}{H m}$$</p>

### Approximation Algorithm

* $$(\epsilon, \delta)$$-Approximation Algorithm
    * $$X$$, real values
    * $$\tilde{X}$$, estimated values
    * Given a relative error of at most $$\epsilon$$ with probability at least $$1-\delta$$ 
        * s.t. $$P(\vert X - \tilde{X} \vert \le X \epsilon) \ge 1-\delta$$

## Lower Bound

* $$H \le \alpha \log m$$, $$O(\log m)$$
* Observed errors on the traffic traces are much smaller than the theoretical guarantees
    * Alogrithm must guarantee the error bound for any stream with any distribution
    * Real packet traces have considerable underlying structure

## Algorithm

### Streaming Algorithm

* Alon–Matias–Szegedy frequency moment estimation algorithm
* Three stages
    1. Pre-processing stage
        * Selsect random locations
        * Decide counters
    2. Online stage
        * Keep an exact counter for the number of subsequent occurrences of that item
            * Select position $$k$$
            * Keep exact counter, $$\alpha _k$$, for the items' location between position $$k$$ and $$m$$
    3. Post-processing stage
        * Use various counters to obtain an estimator for the $$S$$ value for the stream

### Sieving Algorithm

* Online stage
    * Sieve the elephants from the mice
        * Threshold = 2 times
    * For elephants, calculate the count between the first and second sampling
        * Assume the instances are evenly distributed
        * $$\#$$ occurrences of the instances between successive samples should be equal
* Post-processing stage
    * $$S_\text{elephant} + S_\text{mice}$$
