## Background Knowledge and Insight

> Most of the incidents (83%) were executed physically from within the insider's organization and took place during normal business hours
> 
> The impact of nearly all insider incidents in the banking and finance sector was a financial loss for the victim organization: in 30% of the cases the financial loss exceeded $500,000. Many victim organizations incurred harm to multiple aspects of the organization.

### Authentication

* Knowledge: password, PIN
    * Something you know
* Objects: ID card, credit card, access token
    * Something you have
* Biometrics
    * Physiological: fingerprints, retina pattern
        * Something you are
        * Issues: implementation cost, acceptability, stability
    * Behavioral: signature, gait, keystroke dynamics
        * Something you do

### Re-authentication

* Continuous authentication of a user for the duration of the user's login session
* Current user same as user who authenticated
* Stolen credentials
* Approaches
    * Indirect: profiling OS and applications
        * System call invocations, call-stack data operation, program trace analysis
    * Direct: profiling valid user
        * Command line input data, keystroke dynamics, mouse activity, GUI events
* Process
    * Collect clean data from each user
    * Build profile of normal behavior for each user
    * Use profile to compare behavior of current user with that of a valid user
    * Any significant behavioral difference flagged

### Behavioral Biometrics (Re-)authentication

* Attackers evade classical IDS
* Compared with traditional authentication systems
    * Greater comfort
    * Ease of use
* Performance: EER, FAR, FRR, etc.
* Deployment scenarios
    * Open setting
        * Public library, internet cafe
        * Unsupervised learning
        * Only data from valid user available for profiling
    * Closed setting
        * Corporate office, government building
        * Possible to collect data from all users
        * Supervised learning

## Objective of User Re–authentication System

* Computer Security Objective
    * To design and implement an on–line, scalable user re–authentication system founded on the data collected from user's inputs (mouse and keyboard) and Graphical User Interface (GUI) events for the purpose of detecting an attacker.
* Machine Learning Objective
    * To design an accurate, classification system for detecting outliers (e.g., intruders) in high dimensional temporal sequence data when the amount of data per user is limited
* Goal
    1. Detect insiders pretending to be other insiders;
    2. Detect outsiders pretending to be insiders;
    3. Discriminate users in a pair–wise sense;
    4. Determine the sensitivity of user profiles on different hardware configurations;
    5. Discriminate users when they are behaving in an identical manner;
    6. Determine the degree of system's scalability and computational efficiency;
    7. Determine the strength of each data source (e.g., the mouse, keystrokes and GUI) individually and in combination;
    8. Exploit granularity of the data to obtain a comprehensive feature space;
    9. Reduce the candidate feature space to a subset of most predictive features;
    10. Improve the accuracy measure when the amount of data per user dataset is limited.

* Process
    * Collect clean data from each user
    * Build profile of normal behavior for each user
    * Use profile to compare behavior of current  user with that of a valid user
    * Any significant behavioral difference flagged
* Implementation schemes
    * Two schemes
        * 1.Classify one feature vector instance at a time
            * C4.5
            * If the instance matched normal profile, serve request
            * Else, alert sys admin, ask re-auth, or close session
            * May cause high false alarm rates
        * 2.Smoothing
            * Look at a window of n (n between 1-11) feature vector instances
            * If m (m between 1,n) of those matched profile, serve request
            * Overlapping windows
            * W-s old points, s new points
            * s = 50, equivalent to 5 second intervals
            * Reduces time-to-alarm
    * False bell rate
    * Evaluation
        * 10-fold cross validation
* Experimental
    * Pairwise Discrimination
        * Discriminate normalcy
    * Anomaly Detection
        * Detect an insider pretending to be another insider
    * Unseen User Detection
        * Detect an outsider pretending to be an insider
