# Continuous Authentication via Biometric Behavior

## Questions
* What is your general approach to this problem?

* What features did you select and why?

* Analyze the successes and failures of your algorithm. Provide an ROC curve showing the tradeoff between detecting true positives vs false positives.

* Submit answer.csv in response to the test dataset, labeling â€‹each row as coming from that user or not (Notation: 0 for real user, 1 for masquerader). The test dataset contains 3 independent rows per user, so you should provide a label for each of the rows.

* Extra credit: for those that you selected as masquerader, provide top 5 users that are closest

## Goal
* Identify a test record is anomalous or not

## Trainning data
* subject: 
    * 51 subjects
    * s0xx
    * s002-s057
    * Lost $[6, 9, 14, 23, 45]$
* sessionIndex: $[1,...,8]$
* rep: $[1,...,47]$
* $\{\text{H},\text{DD},\text{UD}\}$
* $[\text{period},\text{t},\text{i},\text{e},\text{five},\text{Shift.r},\text{o},\text{a},\text{n},\text{l},\text{Return}]$

## Feature
* `mean`, `std` for every **subject** every **session**
* It is not necessary to remove redundance data, when using manhattan distance
* Useless Feature
    * Assume a idealized subject **the_one**
        * Combined by every **subject**
        * Calculate `the_mean`, `the_std` for every **session**
    * The features of every **subject** are `mean_manhattan` and `std_manhattan`
        * The manhattan distance between **subjects** and **the_one**
    * **We cannot calculate `mean` and `std` for a single test data**

## Cross-validation(Holdout)
* leave 5 **rep**s for every **subject** every **session** (10%)
* Current Rate [0, 600] (TPR)
![correct_rate.0_600](correct_rate.0_600.png)
* Current Rate [0, 240] (TPR)
![correct_rate](correct_rate.png)
* ROC FPR-TPR
![ROC](ROC.png)
* Actually, threshold is used to exclude out outliers
    * The anomalous data can be regarded as outliers
