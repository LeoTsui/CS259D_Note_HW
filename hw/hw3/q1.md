# Forensic Challenge

You receive a letter from a friend, who is suspicious that a neighbor is up to no good. Your friend has not heard anything from the neighbor in a while. However, your friend did capture some of the neighbor's [packets](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs259d/hw/forensics.pcap) about a week ago. Putting the ethical sides of the problem aside, help your friend figure out where the neighbor has gone and what the neighbor is up to.

1. What is the neighbor's name?
2. What is the neighbor's email address?
3. What is the neighbor's email password?
4. What are the email addresses (at least two) of the neighbor's correspondents? What is the email of the correspondent the neighbor is most likely have gone to visit?
5. What is the name of the file containing the meeting location?
6. Bonus: where are they meeting and what is the correspondent bringing?
