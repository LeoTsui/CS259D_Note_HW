## Blending Attacks

### Scheme of a polymorphic blending attack (PBA)

![Scheme-of-a-Polymorphic-Blending-Attack-PBA](images\Scheme-of-a-Polymorphic-Blending-Attack-PBA.png "Scheme of a polymorphic blending attack (PBA)")

### Polymorphism Attacks

* Polymorphism
    * Disguise the packets as normal traffic
    * Change the contents of packets to make it look different
    * Exploit code, not used in normal
    * **Making attacks look different from each other rather than normal**
* Attack Vector
    * Modified part, invariant part
    * Attack invariant could be
        * Small
        * Existing in the normal traffic
    * Could cause high FP
* Attack Body (shellcode)
    * Register shuffling
    * Equivalent instruction substitution
    * Instruction reordering
    * Garbage insertions
    * Encryption
* Polymorphic Decryptor
    * Decrypt shellcode
    * Code obfuscation
* Detection of Polymorphic Attacks
    * Exploit code and/or input data contain some characters that have very low probability of appearing in a normal packet
    * This deviation can be detected

### Polymorphic Blending Attacks

* Making attacks looks different from each other rather
* **Adjust their byte frequency to match that of legitimate traffic (look like normal)**
* Assumption
    * The adversary has already compromised a host X inside a network A which communicates with the target host Y inside network B.
    * The adversary has knowledge of the IDS<sub>B</sub> that monitors the victim host network.
    * A typical anomaly IDS has a threshold setting that can be adjusted to obtain a desired false positive rate.
        * Adversary knows the learning algorithm used by IDS of Network B
        * IDS of Network B is a payload statistics based system
* Adversary's trade-off
    * Attack size
        * Monitor network flow size
    * Process speed
        * Attack should be economical in time and space

### Steps of Polymorphic Blending Attacks

1. Learning The IDS Normal Profile
    * Sniffing the network traffic
    * Generates artificial profile
    * More normal packets captured more closer to the normal profile
    * Profile
        * Average size
        * Rate of packets
        * Byte frequency distribution
        * Range of tokens at different offsets
2. Attack Body Encryption
    * To match the normal profile
        * Substituting every character
        * Padded with some garbage data
    * Reversible operation
    * Generated suitable substitution table
3. Polymorphic Decryptor
    * Remove padding
    * re-substitute characters
    * The decryptor routine is not encrypted but mutated using shellcode polymorphism processing

### Attack Packet Design

* Find a normal profile that similar to the attack packet
    * Character frequency (substitution table)
        * If no significantly different between new and old substitution tables, replace old by new 
    * Packet length
        * Longer than the attack packet
        * Plan B: divide attack body into multiple small packets


## Evading PAYL

### Evading 1-gram

* **Minimize the maximum frequency difference**
* Padding
    * $\hat{\omega}$, substituted attack body before padding
    * $\acute{\omega}$, substituted attack body after padding
    * $\|\omega\|$, length of $\omega$
    * $i$, idx of characters
    * $x$, characters
        * $x_i$, the $i^{th}$ of the characters
    * $\lambda$, $\#$ occurrences
        * $\lambda_i$, $\#$ occurrences of $x_i$
    * $\|\acute{\omega}\| = \|\hat{\omega}\| + \sum_{i=1}^n{\lambda_i}$
    * $f(x_i)$, relative frequency of character $x_i$ in normal traffic
    * $\hat{f}(x_i)$, relative frequency of character $x_i$ in substituted attack traffic
    * $\lambda_i = \|\acute{\omega}\|f(x_i) - \|\hat{\omega}\|\hat{f}(x_i)$
    * For some characters, $f{x_i} < \hat{f}(x_i)$
    * **The most frequent such character need not be padded** 
    * Let $\delta = \max{(\hat{f}(x_i) / f(x_i))}$ be the maximum overuse
    * $\lambda_i = \|\hat{\omega}\|(\delta f(x_i) - \hat{f}(x_i))$
* Substitution
    * To minimize padding we need to minimizeã€€$\delta$
    * Case 1: attack chars are less numerous than legitimate chars
        * A greedy algorithm that generates one-to-many mapping
        * Sort characters by frequency in attack and legitimate Traffic
        * Match frequencies in decreasing order
        * Remaining legitimate characters are assigned to attack characters that have highest to bring it down
    * Case 2: attack chars are more numerous than legitimate chars
        * A greedy algorithm that generates n-gram-to-one mapping
        * Construct a Huffman tree where leaves are characters in the attack traffic, and smallest two nodes are iteratively connected (thus most frequent characters have shortest n-gram length)
        * We must choose the labels for the links so to preserve the original legitimate character frequency
            * Sort vertices in the tree by weight
            * Sort legitimate characters by their frequency
            * Choose the highest frequency character for the highest weight vertex
            * Remove the vertex from the list and remove the given portion of the character's frequency from further consideration; then resort the characters

### Evading 2-gram

* Must match all 2-byte pairs
* Represent valid 2-grams as states in FSM
* A simple approach will enumerate valid paths in FSM and map attack characters to paths randomly but this generates large code size
    * Better mapping can be obtained by using entropy information, i.e., mapping frequent characters to short paths
* Another approach will attempt to find single byte mappings so that 2-grams are also matched
    * Greedy algorithm sorts 2-grams by frequencies in legitimate and attack traffic and matches them greedily taking care not to violate any existing mappings
* Generate padding so to match the target distribution greedily

## Experiment Setup

### Attack vector

* Windows Media Services (MS03-022)
    * Exploits a vulnerability with logging of user requests
* Attacker vector 99 bytes
    * Presented at the start of the HTTP request
* For buffer overflow attack must send 10KB of data
* Attack body opens a TCP connection and sends registry files
* Size of attack body is 558B and contains 109 unique characters
* Attack was divided into multiple packets
    * Divide decryptor into several packets
* After padding, if final blending attack packet not up to 10KB 
    * Send normal packets

### Dataset

* Captured 15 days of HTTP traffic
    * From one department
    * 14 days' traffic to train the IDS (4,356,565 packets, 1.9GB)
    * Last day's traffic is used by the attacker to learn character distributions
    * Only TCP data packets are used that do not contain known attacks
* IDS builds profiles per packet length
* Selected three frequent packet sizes for the attack

## Evaluation

#### PAYL Training

* PAYL training time increases with the size of the training data because new packets carry more unique n-grams

### Traditional Polymorphic Attacks (CLET)

* Tested CLET-generated polymorphic attacks against PAYL
    * CLET only adds padding to match byte frequency
    * Other polymorphic engines perform worse than CLET against PAYL
    * CLET attack sequence will avoid PAYL detection only  if all packets have an anomaly score above the  threshold
    * Both 1-gram and 2-gram PAYL detected all attacks  with chosen threshold setting

### Artificial Profile

* Training of the artificial profile is stopped when there is no significant improvement over existing profile (measured using Manhattan distance)  within two packets
* Number of packets required for convergence

### 1-gram and 2-gram Attacks

* For 1-gram attacks used one-to-one substitution cipher
* For 2-gram attacks used single byte encoding scheme
    * Two types of transformations were tested
    * Substitution table is constructed for entire attack body - global substitution
    * Substitution table is constructed for each packet separately - local substitution
    * If attack characters are more numerous than those in legitimate traffic, non-existing characters were used
* 2-gram IDS had consistently higher anomaly scores for attacks but it also had higher  thresholds to avoid false positives
    * Overall similar performance as 1-gram IDS
    * More costly for IDS
* Local substitution always outperformed global  substitution

## Countermeasures

* Models
    * More complex models
    * Blend more models
* Features
    * syntactic and semantic information
* High speed hardware
* Introduce randomness
    * Random feature

## Limitations and Improvements

* PAYL is the only case study
* Are the assumption of PBA are realistic
* Explore techniques for continuous data streams
