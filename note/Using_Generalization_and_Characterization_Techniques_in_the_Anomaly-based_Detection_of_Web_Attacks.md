## Background Knowledge and Insight

* Web application
    * Easy to develop, deploy, and access
    * Critical security vulnerabilities
        * Lack of awareness of security issues
        * Feature-driven development
        * Time-to-market constraints
* Anomaly detection for web security
    * Pro
        * Adapt to ad-hoc nature of web apps
            * Custom-developed
        *  Identify previously unknown attacks
    * Con
        * Prone to producing false positives
        * Not characterization of attack causing anomaly(the nature of a detected attack) 
* Anomaly generalization
    * Group similar anomalies together
    * Administrator analyzes each group
        * If false positives: Filter
        * If instances of attack: Generate anomaly signature
* Attack characterization
    * Types of exploitations follow specific rules

## Goal

* Detection system can be deployed on an existing web-based system
* Detecting unknown attacks, in the unsupervised fashion
    * **Generalize** similar anomalies
    * **Characterize** the normal behavior

## Architecture

### Event Collection

* Web server access logs
* Source of the events is unknown

### Anomaly detection

* Learns profiles of normal application behavior and detect deviations
* Input: URLs of successful GET requests
* Learning phase
    * Builds profiles of normal behavior for each application parameter
    * Set a dynamic detection threshold for the attribute
* Detection phase
    * Evaluate the observed values of the attribute
    * Outputs: anomaly score, $[0, 1]$
        * $0$, high anomalous value
        * Weighted sum of the individual model scores
    * Alert

### Anomaly signature generation

* Generates anomaly signatures to group "similar" alerts
* Signature set can be modified at run-time
* Similarity metric: model-dependent
* Anomaly signature is generated by the relaxation of the parameters used by the anomaly models

### Anomaly aggregation

* Groups anomalies according to model-specific similarity operations

### Attack class Inference

* Characterizes types of attacks anomalies may represent
* Challenge: Anomalies hard for human analysts to interpret
* Observation: Attack classes violate anomaly models in consistent ways
    * Use consistencies to provide hints to analyst
* Compared with misuse detection
    * Difference: Class inference only applied to anomalous events
    * Advantage: Class inference can be less precise
* Families of attacks
    * Directory traversal
        * Unauthorized access to files on web server
            * Use "." and "/"
        * **Heuristic activated**
            * **Character distribution: dominating char set C intersecting {".", "/"}**
            * **Structural inference: prefix ending in "." or "/"**
        * Attack inference
            * Scan anomalous attribute value for regex (/|\\.\\.)+
        * Example
            * Itemid = "cat ../../../../../etc/shadow"
            * Char distribution model detects high count of . and /
            * Structural inference model detects anomalous structure
            * Attack inference matches (/|\\.\\.)+ & detects directory traversal
    * Cross-site scripting
        * Execute malicious code on client-side machine
        * **Heuristic activated: structural inference, character distribution, token finder**
            * Insertion of HTML tags
            * Use of client-side scripting code as content
        * Attack inference: scan for JavaScript or HTML fragments
            * "script", "<" , ">"
    * SQL injection
        * Unauthorized modifications to SQL queries
            * Escape an input to a query parameter
        * **Heuristic activated: attribute structure**
        * Attack inference
            * Scan attribute value for SQL keywords (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, ', --)
    * Buffer overflow
        * Send a large amount of data
            * overflow a buffer
            * overwrite return address, data, function pointers, sensitive variables
        * Significant deviation from normal profiles
        * **Heuristic activated: character distribution, structural inference, attribute length**
        * Attack inference
            * Scan attribute string for binary values (ASCII chars > 0x80)

## Feature

### Attribute length

* Characterization
    * **Many attribute values are either fixed in size or vary over a small range**
    * Approximate actual(unknown) distribution of attribute lengths
    * Chebyshev inequality
        * Weak bound
* Generalization
    * $\mu$, sample mean
    * $\sigma^2$, variance
    * $l_{\text{obsv}}$, observed attribute length
    * $l_{\text{orig}}$, anomalous attribute length
    * $d_{\text{attr}}$, configurable distance
    * $\psi_{\text{attrlen}}(l_{\text{obsv}}, l_{\text{orig}})$, similarity operator
    * $\psi_{\text{attrlen}} \equiv \lvert \frac{\sigma^2}{(l_{\text{obsv}} - \mu)^2} - \frac{\sigma^2}{(l_{\text{orig}} - \mu)^2} \rvert < d_{\text{attr}}$

### Character distribution

* Characterization
    * **Many attribute take values that have similar character distribution**
    * Typical queries: human readable; Slow drop off
    * ICD(idealized character distribution): Sorted frequencies of 256 chars; Pearson test
    * Relative character frequencies
        * Malicious queries
            * Sharp drop-off, large occurrences of a single character
            * Little drop-off, random character values
* Generalization
    * $m$, $\#$ dominating character value
    * $c_i$, the $i^{th}$ domination character value
    * $f_i$, corresponding relative frequency
    * $C$, set of $m$ dominating character values and frequency pairs extracted from the model
    * $C = \{ (c_1, f_1), (c_2, f_2), (c_m, f_m) \}$
    * $C_{\text{obsv}}$, set of dominating characters from the observed attribute value
    * $C_{\text{orig}}$, corresponding set from he original anomalous value
    * Sharp drop-off
        * $\psi_{\text{cdist}} \equiv min \{ \lvert f_{\text{obsv}, i} - f_{\text{orig}, j} \rvert \} < d_{\text{cdist}}$
    * Little drop-off
        * $\psi_{\text{cdist}} \equiv max \{ \lvert f_{\text{obsv}, i} - f_{\text{orig}, j} \rvert \} < d_{\text{cdist}}$

### Structural inference

* Characterization
    * **Many attribute values can be modeled as strings generated by a regular grammar**
    * Construct probabilistic grammar
    * Anomaly score calculated as product of transition probabilities along path through NFA for a given value
* Generalization
    * Extract prefix up to and including first grammar-violating character
        * Intuition: **Prefix shared by attacks against same app**
    * Mapping
        * "a" for all lower-case alphabetic chars
        * "A" for all upper-case alphabetic chars
        * "0" for all numeric chars
        * All other chars unchanged
    * $\psi_{\text{structure}} ( s_{\text{obsv}}, s_{\text{orig}} ) \equiv s_{\text{obsv}, i} - s_{\text{orig}, i}$

### Token finder

* Characterization
    * **Many attribute takes values that are drawn from a small set of constants**
    * Flags/indices
    * Random/enumeration
* Generalization
    * $lex$, lexicographical similarity function
        * Hamming distance
        * Levenshtein distance
    * $\psi_{\text{token}} \equiv lex(l_{\text{obsv}}, l_{\text{orig}})$
