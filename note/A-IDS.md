* Supervised Framework:
    * Combine results of base IDSs

    * Measure losses between IDS outputs and true label
    * Maintain weights for base IDSs

### Mixing Algorithm

#### Notation

* $T$, $\#$ instances
* $n$, $\#$ base IDSs
* $t$, $(t=1,...,T)$, a certain time or trial
* $x_t$, a vector of $n$ IDS's output
    * A-IDS receives $x_t$
    * $x_t = (x_{t,1}, ..., x_{t,n})$
        * where $x_{t, i} \in \{0\text{(normal)}, 1\text{(attack)}\}$
* $pred(t)$, the prediction of A-IDS
* $y_t$, $y_t \in \{0, 1\}$, the true label of the $t\text{-th}$ instance at the time $t$
* $L$, loss function
    * For the trial $t$, and the $i\text{-th}$ IDS
    * $L_{t, i} = (y_t - x_{t, i})^2$
    * Measure the discrepancy between the true label and the predictions of the base IDSs
* $v_t$, the weight vector maintained by the A-IDS
    * For the trial $t$, and the $i\text{-th}$ IDS
    * $v_t = (v_{t,1}, v_{t,2}, ..., v_{t,n})$
    * $v_{t,i} \geq 0$
    * $\sum_{i = 1}^n v_{t,i} = 1$

#### Mixing Algorithm

* Parameters
    * $\eta > 0$, learning rate
    * $0 \leq \alpha \leq 1$
    * $n$
* Initialization
    * $v_1 = v_0^m = (1/n, ...,  1/n, ..., 1/n)$
* For $t=1 \to T$
    * Prediction
        * $\hat y_t = v_t \cdot x_t$
        * $pred(t)$:
            * $0$, $0 \leq \hat y_t \leq 0.5$
            * $1$, $\hat y_t \geq 0.5$
    * *Loss Update*
        * Find the best IDS from a pool of $n$ base ones
        * $L_{t, i} = (y_t - x_{t, i})^2$
        * $e^{-\eta L_{t,i}}$, a factor
        * $v_{t,i}^m = {v_{t,i} e^{-\eta L_{t,i}}} / {\sum_{j=1}^n v_{t,j} e^{-\eta L_{t,j}}}$
    * *Mixing Update*
        * $av_t = \frac{1}{t} \sum_{q=0}^{t-1} v_q^m$, average weight vector 
        * $v_{t+1} = \alpha av_t + (1-\alpha)v_t^m$

## Experimental

* Setting (Not Mixing Update)
    * Base classifiers:
        * NaïveBayes
        * BayesNetwork
        * Decision Stump
        * RBFNetwork
    * 1O-folds cross-validation
    * Single intrusion detection cannot detect all types
        * Good performance on special segments
        * Need combination
    * *Loss Update*
        * $\eta = 0.1$
    * Not ***Mixing** Update*
        * $v_{t_1,i} = v_{t,i}^m$
        * Combination is not help
        * The performance is almost the same as the best IDS
* Combining (A-IDS)
    * Random permutation
    * 1O-folds cross-validation
    * Mixing Algorithm
        * $\eta = 0.1$
        * $\alpha = 0.001$
        * Uniform Past update
* Expanding (A-ExIDS)

## Limitation

* Double-edge knife of *Lose Update*
    * The best $v_{t,i}$($L_{t,i} = 0$) controls $v_{t,i}^m$
    * Hard to recover if an IDS temporarily performs poorly and then performs well
    * Consequence:
        * Slow adaptation to changes in IDS performances
        * Attackers can change attack patterns all the times
    * *Mixing Update* is used to remember the past average weight vector
